Windows Client for wifikeyboard.
this project will provide a windows client which will connect with andriod using wifikeyboard and user can toggle to wifikeyboard using a shortcut key.
user will also be able to configure shortcut key like volume up, volume down ... etc so can user will not need to switch to browser to send input to andriod which really i dont like,

Thanks <a href='http://code.google.com/p/wifikeyboard/'>WifiKeyboard</a>
for such a nice application.
